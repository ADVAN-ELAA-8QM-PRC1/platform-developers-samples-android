It shows how to check and request permissions at runtime and how to declare permissions for M-devices
only.

        <intro>
<![CDATA[
Android M introduced runtime permissions. Applications targeting M and above need to request their
permissions at runtime.
All permissions still need to be declared in the AndroidManifest. However, when accessing APIs that
require a permission, the Activity or Fragment has to verify that the permission has been granted
or request the missing permissions. Permissions are checked through
Activity#requestPermissions(String[], int) and Fragment#requestPermissions(String[], int).
Permission requests are sent through Activity#requestPermissions(String[]), and the response
received in the callback Activity#onRequestPermissionsResult(int, permissions[], int[]).
Applications can provide an additional rational for the use of permissions after calling
Activity#shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(String). This call will return true if the
application should provide the user with more context on why the requested permissions is needed,
for example if the permission request has been denied before.

If an application targets an SDK below M, all permissions are granted at runtime and are available
when the application is running. However, if permissions have been turned off in the system settings
for an application targeting an SDK below M, the API will return empty or no data.
