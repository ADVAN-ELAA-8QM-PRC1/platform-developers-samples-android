# WearSpeakerSample
A sample that shows how you can record voice using the microphone on a wearable and
play the recorded voice or an mp3 file, if the wearable device has a built-in speaker.

This sample doesn't have any companion phone app so you need to install this directly
on your watch (using "adb").
